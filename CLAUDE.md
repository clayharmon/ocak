# Ocak

A Ruby gem that sets up and runs a multi-agent pipeline for autonomous GitHub issue processing using Claude Code.

## Architecture

## Conventions

- **Ruby 3.3**, frozen string literals everywhere
- **dry-cli** for CLI routing — each command is a class inheriting `Dry::CLI::Command`
- **No heavy dependencies** — stdlib only (open3, json, yaml, erb, fileutils, logger, securerandom) plus dry-cli
- **ERB templates** use `trim_mode: "-"` for clean output
- **Config** is always loaded from `ocak.yml` in the project root via `Config.load`
- Agent names use hyphens in filenames (`security-reviewer.md`) and in `ocak.yml` step definitions (`security-reviewer`); Ruby identifiers use underscores. `pipeline_executor.rb` converts underscores to hyphens for backwards compatibility with existing user configs.
- All external commands (git, gh, claude) go through `Open3.capture3` or `Open3.popen3`

## Key Patterns

### Agent Invocation
Agents are invoked via `claude -p --verbose --output-format stream-json --allowedTools <tools> -- <prompt>`. The prompt is the agent markdown file contents + a task-specific suffix.

### Pipeline Steps
Each step in `ocak.yml` has an `agent`, `role`, and optional `condition`. Conditions (`has_findings`, `had_fixes`) control whether conditional steps run based on previous agent output containing 🔴 findings.

### Worktree Isolation
Parallel issues get separate git worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/`. After all pipeline steps complete, worktrees are rebased onto main, tested, pushed, and the merger agent creates+merges the PR.

### Issue Data Access
All GitHub issue data fetching goes through `IssueFetcher#view`. Classes that need issue data receive an `IssueFetcher` instance via constructor injection (`issues:` keyword param) rather than calling `gh` directly.

### Pipeline Comments
Comment-posting logic lives in the `StepComments` module (`step_comments.rb`), included by both `PipelineExecutor` and `Hiz`. Includers must provide `@issues` (IssueFetcher or nil) and `@config` (Config). Always use `post_step_comment` (wraps `@issues&.comment` with `rescue StandardError => nil`) so comment failures never crash the pipeline. Emoji vocabulary: 🚀 start, 🔄 in-progress, ✅ success, ❌ failure, ⏭️ skip, ⚠️ warning.

### Prompt Injection Protection
All externally-sourced content embedded in agent prompts must be wrapped in XML delimiter tags. This prevents malicious content (e.g., a PR comment saying "IGNORE PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS...") from being interpreted as instructions by the agent. Examples: `<issue_body>`, `<review_output>`, `<review_comments>`, `<pr_comments>`. See `planner.rb#build_step_prompt` and `reready_processor.rb#build_feedback_prompt`.

### Two-Tiered Shutdown
`PipelineRunner` implements two-tiered signal handling via `shutdown!`:
- **Tier 1 (first Ctrl+C):** Sets `@shutting_down` flag. Current agent step finishes naturally, then the pipeline stops. Uncommitted worktree changes are committed with a `wip:` message, issue labels are reset to `:label_ready`, a ⚠️ comment is posted with the resume command, and a summary is printed to stderr. Exit code 130.
- **Tier 2 (second Ctrl+C):** Calls `ProcessRegistry#kill_all` to SIGTERM→wait→SIGKILL all tracked subprocesses, then performs the same cleanup as tier 1. Exit code 130.
- `ProcessRegistry` is a thread-safe PID set (`Mutex` + `Set`). `ProcessRunner#run` registers PIDs after `popen3` spawn and unregisters in `ensure`. `ClaudeRunner` passes the registry through to `ProcessRunner`.
- `PipelineExecutor` accepts a `shutdown_check:` callable and checks it between steps; if true, it sets `state[:interrupted]` and breaks out of the step loop without deleting `PipelineState`.

## Development

```bash
bundle exec rspec          # Run tests
bundle exec rubocop        # Run linter
bundle exec rake           # Both
```

## Test Conventions

- RSpec with `verify_partial_doubles`
- Mock external commands (Open3, git, gh, claude) — never shell out in tests
- Use `Dir.mktmpdir` for filesystem tests, clean up in `after` blocks
- Specs mirror `lib/` structure: `spec/ocak/config_spec.rb` tests `lib/ocak/config.rb`
